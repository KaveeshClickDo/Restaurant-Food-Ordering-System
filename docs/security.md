# Security Model

## Authentication by Portal

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credential | `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable |
| Comparison | `crypto.timingSafeEqual` — prevents timing attacks |
| Session | Signed JWT in an httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure (production) cookie |
| Expiry | 24 hours (`COOKIE_MAX_AGE`) |
| Route guard | Every admin API route calls `isAdminAuthenticated()` before processing |

Login: `POST /api/admin/auth` → sets `admin_session` cookie.
Session check: `GET /api/admin/auth` → returns `{ ok: true/false }`.
Logout: `DELETE /api/admin/auth` → clears cookie.

### Waiter App (`/waiter`)

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credential | 4-digit PIN stored in `app_settings.waiters[].pin` |
| Validation | Server-side only via `POST /api/waiter/auth` |
| Client exposure | `/api/waiter/config` returns staff profiles **without** `pin` fields |
| Session | In-memory React state (cleared on page refresh) |

Waiter API routes do not re-check roles server-side — void and refund are gated client-side by `waiter.role === "senior"`. The waiter app is a trusted in-restaurant screen and not exposed to the public internet.

### Driver App (`/driver`)

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credential | Email + password |
| Storage | `password_hash` (bcrypt) in the `drivers` table |
| Validation | Server-side via `POST /api/auth/driver` |
| Session | `localStorage` (browser-persisted) |

The `drivers` table is never accessible to the anon Supabase role — see RLS policy below.

### POS Terminal (`/pos`)

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credential | 4-digit PIN stored in `localStorage` |
| Validation | Client-side only |
| Rationale | POS is a trusted, physically secured in-restaurant terminal |

### Customer Portal (`/`, `/account`)

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credential | Email + plaintext password (demo system) |
| Storage | `password` column in `customers` table |
| Validation | Client-side check in AppContext `login()` |
| Note | For production, replace with Supabase Auth or NextAuth |

## Supabase Row Level Security

RLS is **enabled on every table**. The anon key — which is exposed in the browser — can only read, and only on specific tables.

| Table | Anon SELECT | Anon INSERT | Anon UPDATE | Anon DELETE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `app_settings` | Yes | No | No | No |
| `categories` | Yes | No | No | No |
| `menu_items` | Yes | No | No | No |
| `customers` | Yes (no `password` col — see below) | No | No | No |
| `orders` | Yes | No | No | No |
| `drivers` | **No** (explicit deny policy) | No | No | No |
| `reservation_customers` | **No** | No | No | No |

All write operations (orders, customers, refunds, status changes, guest profiles) go through Next.js API routes that use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — which bypasses RLS entirely and is never sent to the browser.

### Column-level security

```sql
revoke select (password) on customers from anon;
```

The `password` column on `customers` is revoked from the PostgREST anon role so it is never returned by any query made with the anon key. The service role (used in API routes) retains full access.

### Drivers — explicit deny policy

```sql
create policy "deny_anon_all" on drivers
  for all to anon
  using (false) with check (false);
```

Even with RLS enabled and no policies, Postgres defaults to deny. This explicit policy makes the intent unambiguous and silences the "RLS enabled, no policies" linter warning. The same pattern applies to `reservation_customers`.

## API Route Security

### Which key is used where

| Context | Supabase client | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Browser components / AppContext | `supabase` (from `lib/supabase.ts`) | Anon key — read-only |
| Next.js API routes | `supabaseAdmin` (from `lib/supabaseAdmin.ts`) | Service role key — full access |

### Admin API guard

```typescript
// lib/adminAuth.ts
export async function isAdminAuthenticated(): Promise<boolean>

// Usage in every admin route:
if (!(await isAdminAuthenticated())) return unauthorizedResponse();
```

Routes that bypass this guard are intentionally public:
- Waiter routes — PIN-validated at the app level; trusted in-restaurant screen
- KDS status route — no sensitive data; trusted in-restaurant screen
- POS routes — POS manages its own staff auth; trusted terminal
- `/api/ping` — returns 204 only; no data disclosed
- `/api/guest-profile` — no auth required (anon customer flow); accepts name, email, phone, orderTotal only; cannot read or delete data

### Order INSERT

Online orders are inserted via `POST /api/orders` (server-side, service role). The anon role has no INSERT on `orders`. This prevents clients from:
- Inserting orders with arbitrary statuses (e.g. `"delivered"`)
- Manipulating totals
- Bypassing coupon validation

### Guest Profile Upsert

`POST /api/guest-profile` is intentionally unauthenticated — it is called from the browser after a guest checkout completes. Security considerations:

- It can only **upsert** a profile by email — it cannot read profiles or list records
- It accepts only four fields: `name`, `email`, `phone`, `orderTotal`
- Invalid or missing email returns a 400 error
- The `reservation_customers` table has no anon SELECT — data cannot be read back through the API

### Customer INSERT

Customers are inserted via `POST /api/auth/register` (service role). The anon role has no INSERT on `customers`. This ensures:
- Email uniqueness is enforced server-side
- Passwords (demo plaintext) are never inserted client-side

## Sensitive Environment Variables

| Variable | Where used | Safe to expose? |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Browser + server | Yes (anon key has limited access) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Browser + server | Yes (read-only with RLS) |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Server-side API routes only | **No** — full DB access |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Server-side `lib/adminAuth.ts` only | **No** |

SMTP, Stripe, and PayPal credentials are stored in `app_settings` (Supabase, service role only) and are never sent to the browser — they are read and used exclusively inside API routes.

## Production Hardening Checklist

- [ ] Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a long, random string (≥ 32 chars)
- [ ] Rotate `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if it was ever exposed
- [ ] Serve the app over HTTPS (cookie `Secure` flag is set automatically when `NODE_ENV=production`)
- [ ] Restrict Supabase project to your production domain in the CORS settings
- [ ] Replace plaintext customer password storage with Supabase Auth or NextAuth
- [ ] Enable Supabase database backups
- [ ] Set up Supabase Auth Rate Limiting to prevent brute-force on the anon key
- [ ] Review `/api/guest-profile` rate limiting if spam submissions are a concern
